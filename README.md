# ECE570_GAN
Work done for term paper for ECE 570 at Purdue University (2018)

There are 2 folders: one corresponding to each of the implementations discussed in the paper.
CUBS data and text embedding data need to be copied to the Data folder to run the StackGAN code. Go through the jupiter notebook Stack_GAN.ipynb for how to set-up the environment for StackGAN.

Please note that the references and credits to the original authors are done in the paper. Please cite those works if you intend to use their materials or code. Also cite my paper or my github page if you intend to use my code.
